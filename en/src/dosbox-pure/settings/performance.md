The `Core Options` → `Performance` menu contains settings related to game performance. These options can be useful if a game runs too slow or too fast.

This option allows you to select the speed of the emulated computer. You can choose from predefined options or use one of the special modes.

### AUTO

In this mode, the emulator will automatically adjust its speed to match the requirements of the running game.

### MAX

The highest possible emulation speed. The actual speed will depend on your CPU’s single-threaded performance.

## Maximum Emulated Performance

Sets an upper limit on emulation speed, used in both `AUTO` and `MAX` modes.

## Limit CPU Usage

Limits the CPU load imposed by the emulator. This is useful if the emulator is putting too much strain on your system.
